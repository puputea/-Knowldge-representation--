Lua Finite State Machine
========================

This standalone lua module provides a finite state machine for your pleasure.
Based **heavily** on Jake Gordon's
[javascript-state-machine](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine).

Download
========

You can download [statemachine.lua](https://github.com/kyleconroy/lua-state-machine/raw/master/statemachine.lua).

Alternatively:

    git clone git@github.com:kyleconroy/lua-state-machine


Usage
=====

In its simplest form, create a standalone state machine using:

```lua
local machine = require('statemachine')

local fsm = machine.create({
  initial = 'green',
  events = {
    { name = 'warn',  from = 'green',  to = 'yellow' },
    { name = 'panic', from = 'yellow', to = 'red'    },
    { name = 'calm',  from = 'red',    to = 'yellow' },
    { name = 'clear', from = 'yellow', to = 'green'  }
}})
```

... will create an object with a method for each event:

 * fsm:warn()  - transition from 'green' to 'yellow'
 * fsm:panic() - transition from 'yellow' to 'red'
 * fsm:calm()  - transition from 'red' to 'yellow'
 * fsm:clear() - transition from 'yellow' to 'green'

along with the following members:

 * fsm.current   - contains the current state
 * fsm.currentTransitioningEvent - contains the current event that is in a transition.
 * fsm:is(s)     - return true if state `s` is the current state
 * fsm:can(e)    - return true if event `e` can be fired in the current state
 * fsm:cannot(e) - return true if event `e` cannot be fired in the current state

Multiple 'from' and 'to' states for a single event
==================================================

If an event is allowed **from** multiple states, and always transitions to the same
state, then simply provide an array of states in the `from` attribute of an event. However,
if an event is allowed from multiple states, but should transition **to** a different
state depending on the current state, then provide multiple event entries with
the same name:

```lua
local machine = require('statemachine')

local fsm = machine.create({
  initial = 'hungry',
  events = {
    { name = 'eat',  from = 'hungry',                                to = 'satisfied' },
    { name = 'eat',  from = 'satisfied',                             to = 'full'      },
    { name = 'eat',  from = 'full',                                  to = 'sick'      },
    { name = 'rest', from = {'hungry', 'satisfied', 'full', 'sick'}, to = 'hungry'    },
}})
```

This example will create an object with 2 event methods:

 * fsm:eat()
 * fsm:rest()

The `rest` event will always transition to the `hungry` state, while the `eat` event
will transition to a state that is dependent on the current state.

>> NOTE: The `rest` event could use a wildcard '*' for the 'from' state if it should be
allowed from any current state.

>> NOTE: The `rest` event in the above example can also be specified as multiple events with
the same name if you prefer the verbose approach.

Callbacks
=========

4 callbacks are available if your state machine has methods using the following naming conventions:

 * onbefore**event** - fired before the event
 * onleave**state**  - fired when leaving the old state
 * onenter**state**  - fired when entering the new state
 * onafter**event**  - fired after the event

You can affect the event in 3 ways:

 * return `false` from an `onbeforeevent` handler to cancel the event.
 * return `false` from an `onleavestate` handler to cancel the event.
 * return `ASYNC` from an `onleavestate` or `onenterstate` handler to perform an asynchronous state transition (see next section)

For convenience, the 2 most useful callbacks can be shortened:

 * on**event** - convenience shorthand for onafter**event**
 * on**state** - convenience shorthand for onenter**state**

In addition, a generic `onstatechange()` callback can be used to call a single function for _all_ state changes:

All callbacks will be passed the same arguments:

 * **self**
 * **event** name
 * **from** state
 * **to** state
 * _(followed by any arguments you passed into the original event method)_

Callbacks can be specified when the state machine is first created:

```lua
local machine = require('statemachine')
